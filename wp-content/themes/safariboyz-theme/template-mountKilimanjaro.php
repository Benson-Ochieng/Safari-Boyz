        <h2>ITINERARY</h2>
        <p class="det-top-p">
          Avail of the phenomenal 6-day Mount Kilimanjaro Trek and accomplish
          the pride of conquering one of the seven summits in the world. This
          trek starts and ends at Moshi and includes the road transfer from your
          accommodation at Moshi and back. It takes place through the oldest and
          the most well-established route - Marangu Route, also known as the
          ‘Coca-Cola route. Many prefer the Marangu route because it is believed
          to be the easiest path on the mountain because of its gradual slope.
          It is also the only route that offers sleeping huts in dormitory-style
          accommodations. Spending an additional acclimatization day on the
          mountain is highly recommended when climbing Kilimanjaro using the
          Marangu route. The typical itinerary for the trek is listed as
          follows:

              <p>
                Our guide will report to your lodge in Moshi. Have breakfast and
                leave for Marangu Gate. After completion of the paperwork and a
                mountain brief by our lead guide, begin your trek with a hike
                through the dense rainforest. Enjoy the views of beautiful
                vegetation while you walk and you may also catch a glimpse of
                some primates as you head to the Mandara Hut. Reach Mandara Hut
                and rest as you wait for a sumptuous dinner and overnight stay
                at Mandara Huts.

                the next destination - Horombo Hut through the timberline via
                entering the heath and moor zone. The 4-6 hour hike will take

              </h3>
              <p>
                Have breakfast at the camp and get ready for your trek to Zebra
                Rocks, which serves as an acclimatization and strongly enhances
                your chance of success in reaching the summit. A 4-hour trek
                takes you to the Zebra Rocks, which gets its name from the
                distinctive black and white stripes on its formation. After your
                hike to Zebra Rocks, return to Horombo Hut for a warm and
                delicious lunch. Relax in the afternoon at your camp and regain
                your strength for hiking the next day.

              <p>
                After your breakfast at Horombo Hut, begin your trek towards
                Kibo Hut, which serves as a basecamp for attempting the final
                hike to Uhuru peak (the summit.) This stage is tough, and you
                will pass the ‘Last Water Point,’ which is your chance to
                collect water. Continue your trek through this nearly
                vegetation-less plateau that joins the main summit of Kibo with
                Mawenzi. Reach Kibo Hut and enjoy an early evening meal followed
                by an early night in preparation for the summit attack at night.

              </h3>
              <p>
                Begin your final ascent around midnight for your summit. The
                long and strenuous trail passes the Hans Meyer Cave (5220m) and
                you climb slowly upwards towards Gillman’s Point (5681m.) Reach
                Gillman’s Point at sunrise, which is the crater rim of
                Kilimanjaro, where the sun starts to warm up the land. Hike
                further for 1-2 hours and reach Uhuru Peak (5895m) - the highest
                peak in the entire African continent. Finally, after trekking
                through 5 distinct climates and ecosystems, you climb Mount
                Kilimanjaro and reach the summit. The breathtaking views from
                the peak are something out of this world. After the summit and a
                brief photo session, return to Kibo Hut, where a warm meal
                awaits you. After the meal and 1-2 hour break, start descending
                back to Horombo Hut.

                of Africa.
