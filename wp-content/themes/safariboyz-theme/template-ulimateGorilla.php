                Full-Day Gorilla Trekking In Bwindi Impenetrable National Park
              </h3>
              <p>
                Have breakfast early in the morning and depart for the starting
                point where you will be briefed about your gorilla trekking
                adventure. The trek begins from the site where gorillas were
                spotted a day before and experienced gorilla trekkers guide you
                through the slopes and volcanoes of the park.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bwindi Impenetrable National Park has 17 gorilla groups making
                it the best place to witness the gorillas in the wild. The tour
                gives you an opportunity to closely observe 90 mammal species
                and 11 primates, including the black and white colobus monkey.

                incredible experience. Follow the mountain gorillas as they go
                freely in the impenetrable forest and discover their gorgeous
                natural habitat.
