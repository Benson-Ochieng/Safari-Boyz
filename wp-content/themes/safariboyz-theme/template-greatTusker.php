        <h2>ITINERARY</h2>
        <p class="det-top-p">
          Enjoy an enthralling 8-day 'The Great Tusker' safari that starts and
          ends at Nairobi, taking you on an adventure to all the last remaining
          safe havens of the free-roaming elephants with the largest horns,
          known as the great tuskers. Only a few of such elephants, probably as
          low as 20, call Kenya their home. On this tour, you traverse through 3
          national parks: The Amboseli National Park, Tsavo East and Tsavo West,
          which are interconnected and form the single largest wildlife
          ecosystem in Kenya. The typical safari itinerary is listed below:

                the afternoon game drive. The Amboseli National Park is at the

                with breathtaking views of the fantastic backdrop of the
                mountain. Our team will take you to the best vantage points
                where you can witness incredible wildlife views, such as bathing
                elephants, lion hunts and cheetahs resting in their natural
                habitat. After your game drive, return to your camp for dinner
                and an overnight stay at the selected lodge.
