                point where you will be briefed about your gorilla trekking
                adventure. The trek begins from the site where gorillas were
                spotted a day before and experienced gorilla trekkers guide you
                through the slopes and volcanoes of the park.
              </p>
              <p>

                gives you an opportunity to closely observe 90 mammal species

                The hike in the park can be physically demanding, but watching

                incredible experience. Follow the mountain gorillas as they go
                freely in the impenetrable forest and discover their gorgeous
                natural habitat.
