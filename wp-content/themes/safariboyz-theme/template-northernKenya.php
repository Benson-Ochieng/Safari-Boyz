          Enjoy the amazing 7-day 'Northern Kenya Safari Circuit' tour that
          takes you through the most iconic national reserves of northern Kenya.
          Your safari starts at Ol Pejeta, which is a wildlife conservancy
          sandwiched between the Aberdare Range and Mount Kenya. Along with the

          experiences. You'll then head northwards into the arid and semi-arid
          lands of Samburu National Park, and finally end your safari in the
          dense forests of Aberdare National Park. The typical safari itinerary
          is listed below:
