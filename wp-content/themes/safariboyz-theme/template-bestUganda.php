                Full-Day Gorilla Trekking In Bwindi Impenetrable National Park
              </h3>
              <p>
                Have breakfast early in the morning and depart for the starting
                point where you will be briefed about your gorilla trekking
                adventure. The trek begins from the site where gorillas were
                spotted a day before and experienced gorilla trekkers guide you
                through the slopes and volcanoes of the park.
              </p>
              <p>
                Bwindi Impenetrable National Park has 17 gorilla groups making
                it the best place to witness the gorillas in the wild. The tour
                gives you an opportunity to closely observe 90 mammal species
                and 11 primates, including the black and white colobus monkey.
              </p>
              <p>
                The hike in the park can be physically demanding, but watching
                gorillas play, eat, rest and bond with their young ones is an
                incredible experience. Follow the mountain gorillas as they go
                freely in the impenetrable forest and discover their gorgeous
                natural habitat.
              </p>
              <p>
                After your gorilla trekking safari tour, head back to the lodge.
                If your trek is relatively short, you can go for a guided nature
                walk around the lodge and the surrounding communities in the
                evening. Return to the lodge for dinner and an overnight stay.
